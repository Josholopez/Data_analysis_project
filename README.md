## 📈 Analysis and Suggestions

### **Dataset 1 Analysis**
1. **Anomaly Detection**
   The approach used was as follows
   - Identify the data type of each column.
   - Detect missing or null values.
   - Define rules for outliers, such as future dates, duplicate values, or values outside the expected range.
   - Create a column flagging anomalies to be shared with the team for correction.

2. **User Distribution**
   - The most represented region in this dataset is region_id 2.0, accounting for 13.67% of users.
   - In contrast the least represented region is region_id 23.0 with only 0.04% of users.

3. **Retention Analysis**
   - Customers who performed only one activity can be identified by comparing the first_activity and last_activity columns; if both columns have the same value for a customer, it indicates a single activity.
The percentage of user who did only one activity is 44.06%

4. **Customer Activation Suggestions**
   - Generate and share a specific list of target users (with details) with the Marketing team and Customer Retention managers.
   - Recommend launching a customized marketing campaign tailored to these users.
   - Suggest offering attractive coupons or discounts to motivate them to return and complete their first purchase.
   - Propose regional targeting for campaigns in areas with a high concentration of these users.

### **Dataset 2 Analysis**
1. **Price Suitability**
   - The most suitable price for users is 17 zł, because across all combinations of test dates and groups with the four different prices, 17 zł consistently generated the highest number of transactions, indicating that users are most willing to purchase at this price.

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - The second most preferred price is 22zl; it ranked 2nd on 5 out of 8 test days, in the number of users who concluded a transaction.
The third most preferred price is 27 zł; it ranked 2nd on 3 out of 8 test days, but dropped to 4th on the last test day.

3. **Price Recommendation**
The price that should be introduced is 17 zł, as it ranked 1st on every test date in terms of the number of users completing a transaction.
However, from a revenue perspective, 17 zł generated the lowest revenue on 7 out of 8 test dates. In comparison, the 27 zł price ranked 1st in total revenue on 3 out of 8 test dates and also ranked 2nd in user preference on 3 out of 8 test days.
For instance, on Wednesday, 2012-03-14, and Sunday, 2012-03-18, 27 zł ranked 2nd in user transactions but 1st in revenue generation. I suggest conducting new tests on these specific days of the week to further investigate price performance.
